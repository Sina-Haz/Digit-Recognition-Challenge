Here is a small repository where I solve the famous digit recognition problem with Neural Networks.

Quick Overview:
1) In Digit_Recognition.ipynb I use custom libraries such as micrograd (which I learned to create thanks to Andrej Karpathy) and then my own library Vectorgrad (also on Github)
2) In Matrix_NN_Numpy.ipynb I use the literal definition of Neural Networks as just a collection of intermediate functions where data goes through a linear combination and then an activation function for each layer. I solve the problem with just Numpy and matrix math and derivatives
